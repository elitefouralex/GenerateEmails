# GenerateEmails

After watching a few tutorials i decided to create a completely original script to generate emails from a given list of first and last names plus a few common email domains. 
Im looking to improve on this and learn how to take the list in the code, put it into a spreadsheet, and extrapolate the data from there instead, thus giving me a much cleaner and more professional looking script.
